Hi, my name is Aleksandra Staneva. 
I am a technical support engineer with 10+ years of experience in the field.

My passion for technologies led me to pursue the Python Software Engineering path at SoftUni, where Iâ€™m developping new skills in programming, algorithms, and software development to transition into a more development-focused role.
